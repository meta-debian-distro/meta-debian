SUMMARY = "Audio visualization framework"
DESCRIPTION = "\
Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows\
applications to easily access and manage visualization plugins.	\
Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images \
that are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played \
by a media player.  Most audio visualization is tied to a specific \
application or media player, making it difficult to share code.	\
Libvisual allows applications to use existing visualization plugins \
written for the libvisual framework.\
