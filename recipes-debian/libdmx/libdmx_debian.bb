SUMMARY = "X11 Distributed Multihead extension library"
DESCRIPTION = "\
libdmx is an interface to the DMX extension for X, which allows a single \
server to be set up as a proxy spanning multiple servers -- not unlike \
Xinerama across discrete physical machines.  It can be reconfigured \
on the fly to change the layout, and it is presented as a single logical \
display to clients. \
