SUMMARY = "Event loop abstraction for Libraries"
DESCRIPTION = "Libverto exists to isolate libraries from the particular event loop \
chosen by an application. Libverto provides an asynchronous \
programming interface independent of any particular event loop and \
allows applications to attach this interface to whatever event loop \
they select."
