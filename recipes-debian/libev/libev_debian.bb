SUMMARY = "high-performance event loop library modelled after libevent"
DESCRIPTION = "libev provides a full-featured and high-performance event loop that is \
loosely modelled after libevent. It includes relative timers, absolute \
timers with customized rescheduling, synchronous signals, process status \
change events, event watchers dealing with the event loop itself, file \
watchers, and even limited support for fork events. It uses a priority \
queue to manage timers and uses arrays as fundamental data structure. It \
has no artificial limitations on the number of watchers waiting for the \
same event."
