SUMMARY = "GNU tool that controls the build process"
DESCRIPTION = "Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a \
program from the program's source files.  Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file \
called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute it from other files."
