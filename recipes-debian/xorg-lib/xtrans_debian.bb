SUMMARY = "XTrans: X Transport library"

DESCRIPTION = "The X Transport Interface is intended to combine all \
system and transport specific code into a single place.  This API should \
be used by all libraries, clients and servers of the X Window System. \
Use of this API should allow the addition of new types of transports and \
support for new platforms without making any changes to the source \
except in the X Transport Interface code."
