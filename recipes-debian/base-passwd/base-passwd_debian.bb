# Patch nobash.patch, noshadow.patch and disable-docs.patch
# can not apply, so nobash_edited.patch, noshadow_edited.patch
# and disable-docs_edited.patch were created with same purpose.
#
# Patch remove_cdebconf.patch remove all related part of libdebconf
# in base-passwd because libdebconf was not supported and the function
# related to libdebconf is not important.
